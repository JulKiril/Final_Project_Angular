# Final_Project_Angular
This is the final project, developed during the 2-weeks practice in the Logos Academy after the completion
the 6-months cource of WebDevelopment.
For my project I chose the development of the website for nutritionist.
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.0.6.
During the development I used the next frameworks, libraries and plugins:bootstrap(css),Angular Material datepicker, 
AOS Animation, NgxUiLoader, NgxPagination,json-server.
# Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

# Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.

Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

# Running end-to-end tests
Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.
